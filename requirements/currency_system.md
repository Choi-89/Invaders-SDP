# Team Introduction
Our goal is to enhance the user experience by introducing a currency system into the Space Invader game. This allows players to make strategic decisions in-game and encourages long-term engagement. Our vision is to create an immersive, creative gaming environment that provides greater fun and challenges through a sustainable in-game economy system.

# Team Requirements
We aim to add a currency feature to the Space Invader game, allowing players to make strategic choices and stay engaged in the game for a longer period.

# Detailed Requirements
Introduction of a Currency System:
We will establish a system where players can earn currency by defeating enemies or completing certain missions during gameplay. This currency can be used as a resource to purchase various rewards or upgrades in the game.

Currency Acquisition Mechanism:
Design a mechanism where players automatically earn currency when defeating enemies or achieving specific goals in the game. The amount of currency awarded will vary depending on the enemy or mission.

Currency Usage Feature:
Add a store or upgrade system where players can use the currency theyâ€™ve collected to purchase various items or upgrades. This may include weapons, armor, and character enhancements.

Currency UI Design:
Implement a user-friendly currency balance display on the screen so players can easily check their current amount of currency.

Data Storage:
Design a system that integrates with a database or local storage to save players' currency status and transaction history, ensuring it persists even after the game is closed.

Balance Adjustment:
To ensure the currency system doesn't disrupt game balance, adjust the acquisition and spending amounts accordingly. Care must be taken to prevent players from collecting excessive or insufficient currency.
